----My learnings pointwise from this project


0. go mod means pubspec like flutter , specifing versions of other dep mod or packages 
0.1 usually mod name is set per github url , since this creates an local remote setup like flutter thus we can include with abs path instead of ../paths
0.2 cmd are compiled programs code
0.3 internal my dependencies  which is used by this 

1. go lang can have more than one exe in one module.
2. go compiles code to exe only if there package main in it
3. one package has one one only main func that tells this packages run from here



<PROJECT RELATED>

1. fmt.fPrintf(conn,msg) is slower since it formats bytes to string instead use conn.Write() since its sends raw data in B/b
2.---------
I/O deadline
    conn.SetReadDeadline(t)
    conn.SetWriteDeadline(t)
Purpose:
    Prevent blocking forever
    Regain control of the goroutine
What it does:
    Fails one read/write call
    Does nothing to the connection itself
    This is not a real deadline. It’s a safety valve.
